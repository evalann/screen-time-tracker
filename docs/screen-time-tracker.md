# Screen Time Tracker
## Overview

As a learning experience I've decided to create a screen time tracking application for use in my home to track the kids' screen time. 

The technologies being used are:
- ASP NET Core
- React
- Docker Container
- Datastore TBC
  - Using CSV file at first

## Requirements
### Admin
* The user should be able to configure **People** for screen time tracking records.
### Capture
* The user should be able to select one or more people from the list.
* The user should be able to select a category of screen time to capture.
* The user should be able to select/enter a specific name for the content.
* The user should be able to input a numeric value in either minutes or hours. 
* The user should be able to save/submit the record.
### View
* The user should be able to view screen time for a specific time period.
* The data should be filterable by **Person**.
* The data should be in a table format with each record presented and totals at the bottom.
* The table should be sortable.
